## Video Downloading

This section describes the steps for downloading the original videos of the **Sekai-Real** dataset.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) video downloader
- python3

### üìù Steps

Let's take the `sekai-real-walking-hq` split as an example, see all splits [here]((https://github.com/Lixsp11/sekai-codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-start)).

- Download annotation file `sekai-real-walking-hq.csv` from [here](https://github.com/Lixsp11/sekai-codebase?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-start).

- Extract video URLs from the annotation file and save them to `sekai-real-walking-hq_urls.txt`.

  ```bash
  python csv_to_urls.py --input_file sekai-real-walking-hq.csv
  ```

- Download videos to `./videos` with yt-dlp.

  ```bash
  yt-dlp -N 10 -f 299+bestaudio -a sekai-real-walking-hq_urls.txt -o "./videos/%(id)s.%(ext)s"
  ```

  This command will download each video in 1080p at 60fps with the best available audio quality.
